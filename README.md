# This is a challenging task for Fyber company.

The task interacts with Fyber developer API and displays results in a proper way.
As I was informed the challenge had taken me about two hours, but it took me about 5 or 6 hours and
I think that still there are a lot of room for improvements, but now it looks like more or less ready for deploy.

I used several common approaches like:

- form object
- data classes and domain objects

RequestsController#create is slightly thick and code may be moved to a service class in order to make it reusable in the future.
But for current specifications it is ok in my opinion.
